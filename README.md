I'm a passionate and pragmatic **software developer** with a strong foundation in **backend and full-stack development**, and a deep interest in building robust, maintainable, and scalable systems.

🔧 **Core Skills & Tech Stack**  
`Java` · `C#` · `Spring Boot` · `React` · `Vue.js` · `Angular (basics)` ·  
`Docker` · `Kubernetes` · `Azure` · `Git` · `CI/CD` · `Maven` · `Gradle` ·  
`IntelliJ IDEA` · `Visual Studio Code`

🛠️ **I enjoy working on**  
- Cloud-native applications  
- Scalable backend systems  
- Modern frontends using React and Vue  
- Infrastructure automation and DevOps pipelines  
- Personal Raspberry Pi projects (because tinkering is fun 🧪)

💼 **Professional background**  
I completed an apprenticeship as an IT specialist in application development and have since gained experience in enterprise environments and academic settings. I combine hands-on experience with a constant drive to learn and apply modern best practices — including **clean code**, **test-driven development**, and **agile methodologies**.
